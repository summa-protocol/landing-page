              The S&amp;P 500, Nikkei 225, LBMA Gold Price PM, and the Fidelity
              Bitcoin Reference Rate are all different benchmarking indices. To
              the uninformed, these indices can appear to be an academic attempt
              at summarizing the market, an advertising pitch to create ETPs and
              structured products, or mere lists of securities. Index
              providers—while frequently academic—however play an extremely
              important role in finance. In this article, we will speak briefly
              about the importance of indices, how they have transformed
              markets, and ways that new indices can pave the way for a more
              robust crypto asset market.

              Index Background
            </h2>

              When
              <a href="etf-primer.html">passive investing</a>
              was created, fund managers worked to diversify idiosyncratic risks
              away by investing in many securities in different proportions. At
              first, these funds were necessarily actively managed, meaning all
              investment decisions were made by the asset management team. Funds
              could be compared to one another, but as individual investors
              struggle to identify the best trades, so too could fund managers.
              A counterfactual portfolio was needed to measure fund performance
              without rules-based interventions, and indices were created to do
              just this; they provide a demonstration of a broad swath of the
              market without intervention. Nonetheless, a fund manager working
              to secure income has different goals than a fund manager aiming
              for growth. To evaluate the performance of managers and create a
              baseline for different markets, indices were developed. Today,
              index creation is still a complex and lively industry, with
              professionals working to create indices in new markets with
              evolving construction criteria. In the following sections, we will
              cover the difference between index types and then continue to
              their impact on markets.

              There are scores of indices across all asset classes. Some vary
              only slightly, while others have big differences that can have a
              large impact on their performance. The role of index providers is
              to conduct research into historical trends to identify strong
              areas for future benchmarking, often providing analysis into
              different aspects of rules. Here are some choices index providers
              can decide that have significant impacts on trading.

              Dividend Treatment
            </h3>
            <p id="1e71831a-4c5c-80cd-8ef0-d09f54d08f15" class="">
              When a public company wants to return funds to their investors,
              they will pass along a dividend. Indices that include such
              equities have to answer the following question: how does this cash
              impact the performance of the fund? Some indices decide to
              reinvest this cash in the index, which actually serves to reduce
              the impact of the dividend issuing company on the performance of
              the fund (only a fraction of the reinvested money would go to the
              performance of that equity). Others simply ignore the cash and
              track only the share itself, meaning that dividends have a
              negative impact on the performance of the index. Properly
              accounting for dividends is very important to traders, especially
              in the case of what are known as special dividends. These
              dividends have important rules that can cause them to be included
              or excluded even in indices that reinvest cash.

              NAV Calculation
            </h3>
            <p id="1e71831a-4c5c-802e-a5bf-eda1b2b46902" class="">
              Each index has a price that can be calculated at any given time
              period, but these funds need to specify a specific way of
              calculating a fair value for a day (or given time period if
              calculated for instance every eight hours). For some indices, the
              closing auction value on a specific exchange day is used to
              calculate the fair value as in equity indices like the S&amp;P
              500, Nikkei 225, and even the LBMA Gold Price PM. Between these
              indices, however, there are differences. For the S&amp;P 500, for
              instance, the stamping price is deterministic at 4pm ET (on full
              market days), whereas for the LBMA Gold Price PM index, the
              auction goes through multiple rounds until all trades clear. This
              has major impacts on trading, as traders hoping to replicate the
              S&amp;P 500 can simply put in auction orders, but traders hoping
              to replicate the gold index cannot unless they are IBA
              participants. This distinction can have great impacts on trading.
            </p>
            <p id="1e71831a-4c5c-802e-8ac0-fd63de84201d" class="">
              Other indices, such as the Fidelity Bitcoin Reference Rate are
              calculated over a given period of time. Over this period of time,
              index providers can specify whether they want to use time-weighted
              or value-weighted average pricing, again making independent
              replication challenging.

            <p id="1e71831a-4c5c-80be-9fcf-f7895de0a1bb" class="">
              Where things can get quite interesting is indices with components
              on many different exchanges. Consider for instance the Quantix
              Commodities Index or the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. The former
              tracks the performance of a basket of commodity futures at various
              weights. Futures do not have auctions, so valuing the price of a
              corn contract for instance on a given day is subject to time
              weighting between 13:14-13:15 CT (on a full trading day). Not all
              commodity settles at the same time, so the NAV value becomes more
              deterministic as more futures settle, such as many energy
              contracts later at 13:30 CT. Nonetheless, some of the commodities
              are traded on US exchanges like CME whereas others are located on
              LME. CME is subject to US holidays whereas LME is subject to UK
              holidays. For this reason, some indices cannot be calculated on a
              daily basis, which again has an impact on trading. The MSCI
              Emerging Markets Index tracks equities from around the world and
              functions similarly, but the underlying equities do have auctions
              when their markets are open. Choosing the fair value when markets
              are closed can lead to significant lags in index valuation.

              Some funds rebalance daily, some funds never rebalance. Some funds
              select components by strict rules, others select components by
              committee or active management. For indices like the

              volatility over the next month rebalances daily, implying large
              slippage costs for traders hoping to replicate it. Other indices
              rebalance quarterly or monthly. Rebalancing time can be
              instantaneous (S&amp;P 500 for instance) or over a series of
              seconds (like the
              <a href="https://www.gmci.co/indices/gmci-30">GMCI indices</a>) or
              days (like some
              <a href="https://www.uscfinvestments.com/uso">USBF indices</a>).
              There are many rules and committees that determine entry and
              removal from indices, related to underlying characteristics like
              liquidity.

              The components of a fund can also have their weight rebalanced
              depending on the index construction, where components can be
              market-cap weighted, price weighted, equal weighted, or any other
              methodology.

              Before going into specific ways indices are important to market
              function, we should also acknowledge market and behavioral
              inefficiencies related to their creation. Under efficient market
              assumptions, securities are accurately priced based on their
              fundamentals. Nonetheless, addition to a major index results in
              outperformance over similar securities. By addition to an index, a
              security receives more attention and becomes more valuable and
              liquid. Simultaneously, these securities also become more highly
              correlated to their index than their weight in their index would
              imply. Each quarter, for instance, when stocks enter the Russell
              2000 or Russell 1000, there is a lead/lag relationship for other
              indices resulting in arbitrage opportunities.

              express is that indices have the ability to shape markets. In the

              Frequently, funds will hope to replicate the performance of
              indices with unique trading strategies. Consider the Aperio team
              at BlackRock and asset management team at Goldman Sachs. These are
              massive, industry leading teams in the tax-lose harvesting
              industry. Each accounts for significant proportions of firm
              profits according to financial statements. The way these funds
              work is investors identify an index of interest, whether it is the
              S&amp;P 500 or Russell 2000, and ask their manager to track its
              performance. To do so, they identify a subset of stocks they
              expect to track the index without duplicating highly correlated
              stocks, for instance, Pepsi and Coke. When Coke is down, they sell
              it and substitute Pepsi, ensuring that investors in general are
              tracking their chosen index but receiving tax losses. The way
              these firms compete is by benchmarking their returns to the given
              index. With this strategy of choosing a small subset, they
              necessarily cannot track the index. Some years this strategy loses
              money (when the market does) in notional terms, so the only when
              to measure a job well done is by demonstrating that the strategy
              did not do worse than the market.
            </p>

              There are many other forms of benchmarked strategies, but in
              summation, each simply aims to demonstrate value without
              underperforming the market. For this reason, the index business
              and the public’s perception of it as “the market” means that it
              serves a psychologically important role which also results in big
              business. Aperio for instance holds over

              The famous hedge fund fee is the 2/20 schedule, meaning a fee of
              2% on the AUM and 20% for performance above a specific threshold.
              This performance fee provides an incentive for managers to spend
              their time working on investing instead of growing AUM. To
              determine the value of outperformance, some funds set a
              predetermined schedule, whereas others set their fees to an index.
              A long/short equities portfolio is likely compared to market
              indices like the S&amp;P 500 or Nikkei 225, but trading equities
              should not be benchmarked to gold performance. Likewise,
              cryptocurrency funds are much more volatile than most other
              assets, so investors should want a clear index to benchmark their
              returns; a fund with perverse incentives for instance could invest
              in BTC and hope for outsize returns if they only need to beat a
              return threshold of say 8%, as the massive movements in the spot
              price could make this easy and the fund does not suffer from
              downside risk. To garner trust and flows into crypto fund space,
              proper benchmarking is necessary to ensure the fee structure is
              palatable to investors.

              Similarly, if a pension fund for instance is interested in
              investing in crypto assets, each investment needs to be evaluated
              against a risk budget. Pensions are inherently risk averse; even
              though they hope to diversify into new spaces, they have a very
              short leash for unnecessarily risky assets. Even with a small pool
              earmarked for crypto, comparing any asset to established risk
              metrics such as models based on the S&amp;P 500 results in alarm
              bells for risk officers. Crypto assets can have outsized returns
              but the volatility prevents investments under established metrics.
              In order for traditional funds to properly measure the
              risk-weighted return of an asset, they need a proper index. We
              believe that when an S&amp;P 500 equivalent becomes established
              for crypto assets and their different subsectors, more
              institutional interest will be possible because more standardized
              risk metrics can be developed.

              An index is basically just a well-researched whitepaper. They are
              inherently impossible to replicate because they do not account for
              various fees, for instance. In reality, when someone wants to
              invest in the S&amp;P 500 for instance, they need to buy the
              Fidelity 500 Index Fund (a mutual fund) or SPY (an ETP), both of
              which likely underperform their benchmark due to various trading
              costs. You can read our primer on
              <a href="etf-primer.html">passive investing</a>
              to understand the difference, but we believe instruments like
              these help build index credibility. There are network effects from
              inflows into funds that hold these instruments and the belief that
              these indices are the “market” in general.

              Many indices are noted to outperform more popular ones over given
              time horizons, leading to debate over the “best” ones, but in
              reality the best ones are the ones people invest in. Index
              providers only succeed when the volume of assets tracking their
              index grows, which is also how index providers profit. For this
              reason, ETP issuers, market makers, and index providers are all
              linked with shared incentive to create better, more tradable
              products. We believe, as stated in our passive investing primer,
              that ETPs have opportunities to improve, helping each of these
              parties.

              Cryptocurrency Indices

              In traditional finance, indices receive great import from a
              variety of parties. Providers such as S&amp;P Global and MSCI are
              large companies that are constantly growing new offerings,
              including into the crypto space. We believe that a necessary step
              to help crypto assets develop credibility is the creation of
              widespread adoption of benchmarks for the crypto space. Bitcoin
              and Ethereum mainly serve this role currently, but there is a
              reason every stock isn’t compared to Nvidia or Ford. New entrants
              are working to create tradable versions of these indices such as
              perpetuals of the CoinDesk20 and GMCI 30, but a perpetual contract
              is not valuable to grow assets under management, a necessary
              component we believe to receive trust and a psychological
              anchoring.

              There are many attempts to develop these passive products, but we
              believe many are inhibited by dependence on traditional finance
              rails. As we continue this essay series, we hope to outline where
              we believe we can lead to a paradigm shift in the trading of these
              indices, which should excite crypto investors and the passive
              trading ecosystems alike.

              Conclusion

              Indices are fundamental to markets. They help provide a measure
              for performance that shapes how investors make decisions,
              particularly related to risk allowances. The establishment of a
              trusted index is necessary to expand trading into new asset
              classes. Creating benchmarks for crypto assets is the next step
              for the space to become sufficiently established.
