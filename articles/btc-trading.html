            <p id="1ea1831a-4c5c-809f-ae72-d29805348b3d" class="">Some ETPs serve particularly well to demonstrate
				interesting quirks related to trading. Many articles have been written about <a
					href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4772216-uvix-wait-for-opportunity-to-short">UVIX</a> for
				instance to demonstrate the costs related to <a
					href="indices2.html">index
					tracking</a>. Grayscale’s BTC provides a great exercise to understand the ETP issuance space and the
				challenges of trading on-chain assets in off-chain wrappers.</p>
			<h2 id="1ea1831a-4c5c-8090-a234-c0c95d9c497c" class="">Background</h2>
			<p id="1ea1831a-4c5c-80bd-a63d-df92864b1d68" class="">For years, Grayscale held the largest publicly traded
				equity to gain exposure to Bitcoin. The fund, GBTC, was a closed-end ETP. With massive investor interest
				in crypto, GBTC as well as many other Grayscale funds received massive inflows, but these products could
				not be made “open-ended” due to regulatory restrictions. As a result, GBTC traded at large premia and
				discounts. In the year before being “opened” following regulatory approval, the fund traded close to 50%
				discount, basically constituting a prohibitive cost to get out of the position. If investors got short
				shares, they risked getting a Reg. SHO notice requiring they buy shares, so they were forced to sit
				long, which is why bids were so low (discount). Investors discounted the fair value by the expected
				holding cost, which is why we see a convergence to fair value around opening. The principles
				demonstrated by GBTC show the importance of an effective creation/redemption mechanism on fair value
				pricing.</p>

			<p id="1ea1831a-4c5c-80ed-b875-cfe80544c749" class="">Eventually, on January 10, 2024, eight other spot
				Bitcoin ETPs received regulatory approval to begin trading, and this cohort of nine all were traded
				“open” resulting in each trading far closer to NAV. GBTC charged the highest fees at the time of listing
				and received steady outflows of AUM, costing Grayscale huge sums of money. To reduce costs, they limited
				redemptions daily which explains the long decay in their holdings.</p>

			<p id="1f51831a-4c5c-807e-8757-ffbc553cb07b" class="">Long prior to the listing of spot bitcoin funds,
				Grayscale had claimed the rights to the ticker BTC (notably not the currency!), and decided to <a
					href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-announces-bitcoin-etf-spinoff">spinoff</a> the fund
				with a lower expense ratio than GBTC to help stem outflows. The spinoff was seeded by 10% of the GBTC
				assets, resulting in a much smaller fund. They did the same with their Ethereum fund ETHE spinning off
				ETH. The smaller funds were advertised as costing “<a
					href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/22/grayscale-mini-ether-etf-big-mac">less than a Big Mac</a>.”
			</p>
			<h2 id="1eb1831a-4c5c-803d-acf7-ec071d112771" class="">Initial Trading</h2>
			<p id="1eb1831a-4c5c-8041-981f-c054a860aaf6" class="">With the expense ratio in line with the market, BTC
				did not suffer from outflows like GBTC. While rival funds had to compete to build AUM, BTC already had
				ample assets due to the spin-off. The question was whether institutional investors would hold it. With
				the low notional, retail investors liked the product, resulting in pretty decent inflows. The low handle
				we believe represented an attempt to rival mutual funds at one of their few advantages over ETPs: the
				ability to invest any amount of money rather than multiples of ~$50 as is the case with other crypto
				funds.</p>
			<p id="1f51831a-4c5c-80ae-a995-eb84c801cdf6" class="">Nonetheless, the managers of the fund realized
				something was wrong, as evidenced by its resulting <a
					href="https://www.grayscale.com/blog/general-updates/btc-eth-reverse-share-splits-are-coming-what-you-need-to-know">reverse
					split</a>. The stated reasoning—”Reverse share splits can help make the trading of securities more
				cost-effective for market participants, and that is what Grayscale intends to do for BTC and ETH”—was
				quite vague. We will dissect the reasoning for this split below, describing benefits, drawbacks, and
				alternative solutions.</p>

			<p id="1eb1831a-4c5c-8094-8468-cfef6ddb81a9" class="">These are all ETPs that hold spot Bitcoin, with slight
				differences. Below we summarize:</p>

			<p id="1eb1831a-4c5c-8093-89c7-e1b9151891fa" class="">So based on the above table, we see that GBTC has very
				high fees relative to the other funds; for the most part the other funds have similar fees. At its peak,
				GBTC held around ~$46B, but investors rotated into cheaper options. The majority of investments moved to
				IBIT, despite for example BITB having a cheaper expense ratio but similar handle and index methodology.
				Unlike most of these funds, IBIT needs to be created/redeemed the day prior to the NAV stamping (<a
					href="https://www.ishares.com/us/library/stream-document?stream=reg&amp;product=IUS-IBIT-B&amp;shareClass=NA&amp;documentId=2212465%7E2340699%7E2275834%7E2249884%7E2301203&amp;iframeUrlOverride=%2Fus%2Fliterature%2Fprospectus%2Fp-ishares-bitcoin-trust-12-31.pdf">page
					70</a>) meaning that market makers need to commit more capital to trading IBIT. Despite these
				weaknesses, IBIT has amassed considerable assets due to the importance of issuer networks. Investors
				rely extensively on BlackRock for asset management so the issuer can drive demand. Smaller issuers need
				to compete to sell their own products, explaining the lower fees offered by ARKB and BITB.</p>
			<p id="1f51831a-4c5c-804a-943c-cc5c1b729a14" class="">Interestingly, all these funds regardless of liquidity
				trade at various premia/discounts since crypto market makers <a
					href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nasdaq-2023-016/srnasdaq2023016-303319-781202.pdf">charge the
					funds</a> to purchase/sell Bitcoin which comes with its own costs, leading all of these funds to
				have similar but large premia/discounts. BITB has average daily trades of 1M shares, IBIT of 44M; both
				have an average spread of one cent. Despite IBIT’s greater liquidity, the premia/discounts are
				practically identical because they reflect the cost of wrapping a crypto asset in a traditional finance
				rail. The more products in the basket, the greater these costs are to end investors. <strong>We believe
					reducing these costs, which will exist for RWAs and memecoins alike are one of the most important
					challenges necessary to innovate ETP markets.</strong></p>

			<p id="1eb1831a-4c5c-8001-bb9b-dc20ab7ef468" class="">Now to BTC: This fund has the lowest expense ratio and
				before the reverse split, shares hovered around $6. That means that to enter positions, investors had to
				pay half the spread of the shares which was around 20bps. Grayscale was correct that the reverse split
				would increase efficiency because investors with a fiduciary duty might not be able to allow that
				transaction cost to excuse slightly lower fees. This reflects an inherent tension in tick size
				constrained markets with investor accessibility. BTC was created with a low handle to appeal to retail
				investors who might not want to only purchase Bitcoin exposure in increments of $40-$50, but low handles
				are unappealing to institutional clients.</p>
			<p id="1eb1831a-4c5c-8085-a28a-d3dba934e34b" class="">Before the reverse split, there weren’t really any
				outflows of BTC. Funnily, since institutions that held GBTC were given BTC, many could not exit their
				position due to the tick size constraint. Following the reverse split, BTC was redeemed many times while
				other funds had inflows (November/December below) as it was much cheaper to sell than before.</p>
