			<p id="2141831a-4c5c-803e-81ef-eb1b13706251" class="">In this paper, we discuss the importance of indices to
				market makers, issuers, and market efficiency.</p>
			<h1 id="1e51831a-4c5c-8044-a5c2-e2b62425a510" class="">Introduction</h1>
			<p id="1e51831a-4c5c-8008-8a56-f01550b9bde4" class="">Indices like the S&amp;P 500, Nikkei 225, LBMA Gold
				Price PM, and the Fidelity Bitcoin Reference Rate all serve to benchmark sector performance. To the
				uninformed, these indices can appear to be an academic attempt at summarizing US, Japanese, gold, and
				Bitcoin markets. Maybe they look just like mere lists of securities, or not really anything more
				important than advertising pitches to create ETPs and structured products. Index providers—while
				frequently academic in nature—actually play an extremely important role in finance. In this article, we
				will speak briefly about the importance of indices, how they have transformed markets, and ways that new
				indices can pave the way for a more robust crypto asset market.</p>
			<h1 id="1e61831a-4c5c-806e-8352-dc016742b7d8" class="">Importance for Issuers</h1>
			<p id="1e61831a-4c5c-808a-96a9-e28ff762dc04" class="">When <a
					href="etf-primer.html">passive
					investing</a> was created, fund managers worked to diversify idiosyncratic risks away by investing
				in many securities in different proportions. At first, these funds were necessarily actively managed,
				meaning all investment decisions were made by the asset management team. Funds could be compared to one
				another, but as individual investors struggle to identify the best trades, so too could fund managers. A
				counterfactual portfolio was needed to measure fund performance with rules-based interventions, and
				indices were created to do just this; they provide a demonstration of a broad swath of the market
				without manager intervention. Nonetheless, a fund manager working to secure income has different goals
				than a fund manager aiming for growth. To evaluate the performance of managers and create a baseline for
				different markets, many indices were developed. Today, index creation is still a complex and lively
				industry, with professionals working to create indices in new markets with evolving construction
				criteria. In many cases, these indices eventually turn into mutual and exchange-traded funds, providing
				opportunities for issuers to profit and investors to cheaply track market segments.</p>
			<h1 id="1e71831a-4c5c-80b4-aba5-d726631ab839" class="">Index Traits</h1>
			<p id="1e71831a-4c5c-80ff-a15b-d93b4f9210f0" class="">There are scores of indices across all asset classes.
				Some vary only slightly, while others have big differences that can have a large impact on their
				performance. The role of index providers is to conduct research into historical trends to identify
				strong areas for future benchmarking, often providing analysis into different aspects of rules. Here are
				some choices index providers can decide that have significant impacts on trading.</p>
			<h2 id="1e71831a-4c5c-80b1-97ee-c3408bfba785" class="">Corporate Actions</h2>
			<p id="1e71831a-4c5c-80cd-8ef0-d09f54d08f15" class="">When a public company wants to return funds to their
				investors, they will pass along a dividend. Indices that include such equities have to answer how this
				cash impacts the performance of the fund. Some indices decide to reinvest this cash in the index, which
				actually serves to reduce the impact of the dividend issuing company on the performance of the fund
				(only a fraction of the reinvested money would go to the performance of that equity). Others simply
				ignore the cash and track only the share itself, meaning that dividends have a negative impact on the
				performance of the index. The latter funds eventually will issue a dividend themselves. Properly
				accounting for dividends is very important to traders. Likewise, fixed income instruments, whether they
				are bonds or interest bearing tokens, have similar impacts, as do spin-offs. These values all impact
				index performance and predicting their impact on underlying assets creates opportunities to profit.</p>
			<h2 id="1e71831a-4c5c-80da-a64b-d9168e119828" class="">NAV Calculation</h2>
			<p id="1e71831a-4c5c-802e-a5bf-eda1b2b46902" class="">Each index has a price that can be calculated at any
				given time period, but these funds need to specify a specific way of calculating a fair value for a day
				(or given time period if calculated for instance every eight hours). For some indices, the closing
				auction value on a specific exchange day is used to calculate the fair value as in equity indices like
				the S&amp;P 500, Nikkei 225, and even the LBMA Gold Price PM. Between these indices, however, there are
				differences. For the S&amp;P 500, for instance, the stamping price is deterministic at 4pm ET (on full
				market days), whereas for the LBMA Gold Price PM index, the auction goes through multiple rounds until
				all trades clear. This has major impacts on trading, as traders hoping to replicate the S&amp;P 500 can
				simply put in auction orders, but traders hoping to replicate the gold index cannot unless they are IBA
				participants. This distinction can have great impacts on trading.</p>
			<p id="1e71831a-4c5c-802e-8ac0-fd63de84201d" class="">Other indices, such as the Fidelity Bitcoin Reference
				Rate are calculated over a given period of time. Over this period of time, index providers can specify
				whether they want to use time-weighted or value-weighted average pricing, again making independent
				replication challenging.</p>
			<p id="1e71831a-4c5c-80be-9fcf-f7895de0a1bb" class="">Where things can get quite interesting is indices with
				components on many different exchanges. Consider for instance the Quantix Commodities Index or the MSCI
				Emerging Markets Index. The former tracks the performance of a basket of commodity futures at various
				weights. Futures do not have auctions, so valuing the price of a corn contract for instance on a given
				day is subject to time weighting between 13:14-13:15 CT (on a full trading day). Not all commodity
				futures settle at the same time, so the NAV value becomes more deterministic as more futures settle,
				such as many energy contracts later at 13:28-13:30 CT. Nonetheless, some of the commodities are traded
				on US exchanges like CME whereas others are located on LME. CME is subject to US holidays whereas LME is
				subject to UK holidays. For this reason, some indices cannot be calculated on a daily basis, which again
				has an impact on trading. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index tracks equities from around the world and
				functions similarly, but the underlying equities do have auctions when their markets are open. Choosing
				the fair value when markets are closed can lead to significant lags in index valuation, making pricing
				during these events very profitable.</p>
			<h2 id="1e71831a-4c5c-8085-ad1e-dbc6cebbe197" class="">Rebalancing and Weighting</h2>
			<p id="1e71831a-4c5c-8025-9e9e-ddeb04f3abc3" class="">Some funds rebalance daily, some funds never
				rebalance. Some funds select components by strict rules, others select components by committee or active
				management. For indices like the <a
					href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/indicators/sp-500-vix-short-term-index-mcap/">S&amp;P
					500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index</a><strong>, </strong>rebalancing is done daily, creating large
				slippage costs for traders hoping to replicate it. Other indices rebalance quarterly or monthly.
				Rebalancing time can be instantaneous (S&amp;P 500 for instance) or over a series of seconds (like the
				<a href="https://www.gmci.co/indices/gmci-30">GMCI indices</a>) or days (like some <a
					href="https://www.uscfinvestments.com/uso">USBF indices</a>). There are many rules and committees
				that determine entry and removal from indices, related to underlying characteristics like liquidity.</p>
			<p id="1ea1831a-4c5c-80f3-9e69-d638e6660b5a" class="">The components of a fund can also have their weight
				rebalanced depending on the index construction, where components can be market-cap weighted, price
				weighted, equal weighted, or any other methodology.</p>
			<h1 id="1e71831a-4c5c-80bc-9891-f344961849ec" class="">Market Impacts</h1>
			<p id="1e71831a-4c5c-8021-bfe9-cd6515a73685" class="">Before going into specific ways indices are important
				to market function, we should also acknowledge market and behavioral inefficiencies related to their
				creation. Under efficient market assumptions, securities are accurately priced based on their
				fundamentals. Nonetheless, addition to a major index results in outperformance over similar securities.
				Through addition to an index, a security receives more attention and becomes more liquid and
				psychologically valuable. Simultaneously, these securities also become more highly correlated to their
				index than their weight in their index would imply. Each quarter, for instance, when stocks enter the
				Russell 2000 or Russell 1000, there is a lead/lag relationship for other indices resulting in arbitrage
				opportunities.</p>
			<p id="1e81831a-4c5c-8097-aa10-cfaec7378c4a" class="">By pointing these idiosyncrasies of markets, all we
				hope to express is that indices have the ability to shape markets. In the following, we express more
				significant impacts of index creation, demonstrating the importance of indices in markets.</p>
			<h2 id="1e71831a-4c5c-807f-8645-e6922647d0ba" class="">Benchmarking</h2>
			<figure id="1eb1831a-4c5c-80f1-bfb5-f831290183c8" class="image"><a href="/assets/images/index2/benchmarking.png"><img
						style="width:709.9874877929688px" src="/assets/images/index2/benchmarking.png" /></a></figure>
			<p id="1e71831a-4c5c-8069-8ac8-c713497d0fea" class="">Frequently, funds will hope to replicate the
				performance of indices with unique trading strategies. Consider the Aperio team at BlackRock and asset
				management team at Goldman Sachs. These are massive, industry leading teams in the tax-lose harvesting
				space. Each accounts for significant profits according to financial statements. The way these funds work
				is investors identify an index of interest, whether it is the S&amp;P 500 or Russell 2000, and ask their
				manager to track its performance. To do so, they identify a subset of stocks they expect to track the
				index without duplicating highly correlated stocks, for instance, Pepsi and Coke. When Coke is down,
				they sell it and substitute Pepsi, ensuring that investors in general are tracking their chosen index
				but receiving tax losses. The way these firms compete is by benchmarking their returns to the given
				index. With this strategy of choosing a small subset, they necessarily cannot track the index perfectly.
				Some years this strategy loses money (like when the market does) in notional terms, so the only when to
				measure a job well done is by demonstrating that the strategy did not do worse than the market.</p>
			<p id="1e91831a-4c5c-8095-9ad5-c3903faa48b6" class="">There are many other forms of benchmarked strategies,
				but in summation, each simply aims to demonstrate value without underperforming the market. For this
				reason, the index business and the public’s perception of it as “the market” means that it serves a
				psychologically important role which also results in big business. Aperio for instance holds over <a
					href="https://s24.q4cdn.com/856567660/files/doc_financials/2025/ar/BLK_AR24.pdf">$120B</a> in assets
				on a strategy that is built around index tracking.</p>
			<h2 id="1e71831a-4c5c-8007-b812-cfb788f28545" class="">Fees</h2>
			<p id="1e71831a-4c5c-804d-b3d5-f4a5a1b81a8a" class="">The famous hedge fund fee is the 2/20 schedule,
				meaning a fee of 2% on the AUM and 20% for performance above a specific threshold. This performance fee
				provides an incentive for managers to spend their time working on investing instead of growing AUM. To
				determine the value of outperformance, some funds set a predetermined schedule, whereas others set their
				fees to an index. A long/short equities portfolio is likely compared to market indices like the S&amp;P
				500 or Nikkei 225, but trading equities should not be benchmarked to gold performance. Likewise,
				cryptocurrency funds are much more volatile than most other assets, so investors should want a clear
				index to benchmark their returns; a fund with perverse incentives for instance could invest in BTC and
				hope for outsize returns if they only need to beat a return threshold of say 8%, as the massive
				movements in the spot price could make this easy and the fund does not suffer from downside risk (as far
				as there are lockup provisions). To garner trust and flows into crypto fund space, proper benchmarking
				is necessary to ensure the fee structure is palatable to investors.</p>
			<h2 id="1e71831a-4c5c-803e-b3fe-e85bf8745ab7" class="">Risk Allowance</h2>
			<p id="1e71831a-4c5c-80af-a1a7-dc08a488087e" class="">Similarly, if a pension fund for instance is
				interested in investing in crypto assets, each investment needs to be evaluated against a risk budget.
				Pensions are inherently risk averse; even though they hope to diversify into new spaces, they have a
				very short leash for unnecessarily risky assets. Even with a small pool earmarked for crypto, comparing
				any asset to established risk metrics such as models based on the S&amp;P 500 results in alarm bells for
				risk officers. Crypto assets can have outsized returns but the volatility prevents investments under
				established metrics. In order for traditional funds to properly measure the risk-weighted return of an
				asset, they need a proper index. We believe that when an S&amp;P 500 equivalent becomes established for
				crypto assets and their different subsectors, more institutional interest will be possible because more
				standardized risk metrics can be developed.</p>
			<h2 id="1ea1831a-4c5c-80ce-979b-e9697d149c4a" class="">Liquidity</h2>
			<p id="1ea1831a-4c5c-80ee-ad08-e63660fc586a" class="">An index on its own is basically just a
				well-researched whitepaper. They are inherently impossible to replicate because they do not account for
				various fees, for instance. In reality, when someone wants to invest in the S&amp;P 500 for instance,
				they need to buy products like the Fidelity 500 Index Fund (a mutual fund) or SPY (an ETP), both of
				which likely underperform their benchmark due to various trading costs and fees. You can read our primer
				on <a href="etf-primer.html">passive
					investing</a> to understand the difference between the two, but we believe instruments like these
				help build index credibility. There are network effects from inflows into funds that hold these
				instruments and the belief that these indices are the “market” in general.</p>
			<p id="1ea1831a-4c5c-805e-b925-c039c9b1774c" class="">Many novel indices are noted to outperform more
				popular ones over historical time horizons, leading to debate over the “best” ones, but in reality the
				best ones are the ones people invest in. Index providers only succeed when the volume of assets tracking
				their index grows. For this reason, ETP issuers, market makers, and index providers are all linked with
				shared incentive to create better, more tradable products. We believe, as stated in our passive
				investing primer, that ETPs have opportunities to improve, helping each of these parties.</p>
			<h1 id="1e71831a-4c5c-803c-814d-ebe226af87a4" class="">Cryptocurrency Indices</h1>
			<p id="1e71831a-4c5c-8010-8467-c80ddfe0d9b6" class="">In traditional finance, indices receive great import
				from a variety of parties. Providers such as S&amp;P Global and MSCI are large companies that are
				constantly growing new offerings, including into the crypto space. We believe that a necessary step to
				help crypto assets develop credibility is the adoption of benchmarks for the crypto space. Bitcoin and
				Ethereum mainly serve this role currently, but there is a reason every stock isn’t compared to Nvidia or
				Ford. New entrants are working to create tradable versions of these indices such as perpetuals of the
				CoinDesk20 and GMCI 30, but a perpetual contract is not suitable to grow assets under management, a
				necessary component we believe to receive trust and a psychological anchoring.</p>
			<p id="1ea1831a-4c5c-80a2-b3a9-cb1fc79c87b6" class="">There are many attempts to develop these passive
				products, but we believe they are inhibited by dependence on traditional finance rails. As we continue
				this essay series, we hope to outline where we believe we can lead to a paradigm shift in the trading of
				these indices, which should excite crypto investors and the passive trading ecosystems alike.</p>
			<h1 id="1eb1831a-4c5c-8093-9fad-ccc325a12544" class="">Conclusion</h1>
			<p id="1eb1831a-4c5c-80cf-81be-c3b5e57e2373" class="">Indices are fundamental to markets. They help provide
				a measure for performance that shapes how investors make decisions, particularly related to risk
				allowances. The establishment of a trusted index is necessary to expand trading into new asset classes.
				Creating benchmarks for crypto assets is the next step for the space to become sufficiently established.
