			<p id="1ff1831a-4c5c-8016-b49e-d6edb74c5ea1" class="">This essay is part of a two part series on indices. In
				this article, we discuss what exactly indices are, their specific traits, and provide some definitions
				for tracking error. This article is intended for those without a strong traditional finance background.
				For those who understand indices, how they are constructed, and their costs are encouraged to just skip
				to our next article which discusses the importance of indices for digital assets.</p>
			<h1 id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8088-ba99-d0f0f5b9b348" class="">Introduction</h1>
			<p id="1fd1831a-4c5c-807f-a3d5-f3d2f1a27ee7" class="">An index is a rules-based basket of securities
				designed to measure the performance of the market, market sector, investment style, or strategy. The
				first index was Charles Dow’s 11-stock railroad index in 1884 that evolved into the Dow-Jones Industrial
				Average in 1896.</p>
			<p id="1fd1831a-4c5c-80e2-8946-d59b0cb18d20" class="">Pooled investing in mutual funds enabled small
				investors to participate in a selected subset of the market (determined by the mutual fund) with the
				benefits of diversification plus lower expenses (ref: ETF primer). Mutual funds were actively managed
				according to a style set out in their prospectus (e.g., U.S. small cap growth, dividend, or value).
				Comparing mutual fund performance across funds was difficult because of style-drift (e.g., large cap
				stocks in a small cap mutual fund) and the lack of benchmarks for the style. Initially, there were no
				benchmarks and companies like Morningstar, providing reviews of mutual fund performance, holdings, fees,
				and adherence to style advertised in their prospectus, did not exist. Standard Statistics published a
				233-stock weekly index from 1923 that was revised and renamed Standard and Poor’s 500 stock (S&amp;P
				500) index in 1957. Other indices were published: Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index (1973), FTSE (UK
				large cap) and Russel 2000 small cap indexes (1984) and Goldman Sachs Commodity index (1991). </p>
			<p id="1fd1831a-4c5c-806e-b41f-db9e05321a60" class="">While initially benchmarks for active mutual funds and
				managers, the indices were used for passive investing. In 1976, Vanguard created the Vanguard 500 Index
				Fund that replicated this index within a mutual fund and with markedly decreased expenses, due to
				elimination of stock research analysts. The performance of Vanguard 500 Index Fund showed that low-cost
				passive investing outperforms the vast majority of active fund managers. </p>
			<p id="1fd1831a-4c5c-804e-94ce-e5e6a8e44db8" class="">Exchange-traded funds or products (ETFs) improved upon
				index mutual funds by lowering costs further and by being tradable throughout market hours (ref ETF
				primer). The mechanisms of ETFs are described in (ref ETF mechanisms). In 1993, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF
				(SPY) was launched followed by a plethora of ETFs based on indices and selected assets (e.g. QQQ:NASDAQ;
				BITO:BTC, TLT:30Y treasury, etc.). ETFs have driven the creation of novel indices to achieve a variety
				of investing goals.</p>
			<p id="1fd1831a-4c5c-80c2-b63c-ec9b1623a103" class="">Today, index creation is still a complex and lively
				industry, with professionals working to create indices in new markets with evolving construction
				criteria. In the following sections, we will cover the difference between index types and then continue
				to their impact on markets.</p>
			<h2 id="1fe1831a-4c5c-8011-973a-e35a38b8c48e" class="">Executive Summary</h2>
			<p id="1fe1831a-4c5c-8012-b2a0-e6cba80476dd" class="">An index is a rules-based basket of securities
				designed to measure the performance of the market, market sector, investment style, or strategy. Indices
				are defined by their: (i) universe definition, (ii) selection rules, (iii) securities weighting schemes,
				(iv) rebalancing and reconstitution schedules, and (v) handling of corporate actions. The Universe
				Definition of the index defines the pool of securities that the index may hold, the listing venue (e.g.,
				NYSE and/or NASDAQ), geography limits, and the liquidity tests. Selection Rules, which filters down the
				pool of securities that the ETF may hold to the official constituent security list, ensures the selected
				stocks for the ETF are consistent with the benchmark and without bias. Selection rules include: market
				cap, factor, and sector screens. The Weighting Scheme assigns a weight factor for each constituent
				security in the index. The Rebalancing Schedule determines how often the index updates its weighting
				schedule and the components of the index. Handling of Corporate Actions defines how dividends, splits,
				spin-offs, mergers and acquisitions, rights, etc will be handled within the index.</p>

			<p id="1fd1831a-4c5c-80c1-bf69-cbd61da6037c" class="">The table above lists the major index categories but
				these intertwine. For example, S&amp;P 500 ETFS (e.g. SPY) hold equities (asset), track US-only assets
				(geography), is market cap weighted (style), and only holds large caps (sector).</p>

			<p id="1fd1831a-4c5c-801b-ab83-e5c08bd0da17" class="">Indices are defined by their: (i) universe definition,
				(ii) selection rules, (iii) securities weighting schemes, (iv) rebalancing and reconstitution schedules,
				and (v) handling of corporate actions.</p>
			<h3 id="2141831a-4c5c-80a8-9b11-c6a0af52b043" class="">Universe Definition</h3>
			<p id="2141831a-4c5c-8051-a6a7-e45db0e16658" class="">Each index defines the pool of securities it may hold,
				selecting based on the listing venue (e.g., NYSE and/or NASDAQ), geography limits, and liquidity tests.
				Setting the pool of securities too broad (all micro-cap stocks) makes the index uninvestable as trading
				costs scale with each additional underlying. The liquidity tests for the index determine whether an ETF
				that tracks the index can trade the constituent securities without substantially moving the market in
				those securities. The liquidity tests include: (1) absolute turnover test (dollar liquidity and share
				count); (2) turn-over ratio filters; (3) trading frequency filters; (4) days to liquidate filters. The
				higher the liquidity test results, the better the ETF tracks the index in real market conditions.
				Collectively, the Universal Definition gauges whether the ETF is investable.</p>
			<h3 id="2141831a-4c5c-800a-828d-d7a1a11ebf95" class="">Selection Rules</h3>
			<p id="1fd1831a-4c5c-80ce-a7a3-ce84bd8e631c" class="">These filter down the pool of securities that the ETF
				may hold to the official constituent security list, ensures the selected stocks for the ETF are
				consistent with the benchmark and without bias. Selection rules include: market cap, factor, and sector
				screens.</p>
			<h3 id="2141831a-4c5c-80f6-aef3-f93750414a50" class="">Weighting Scheme</h3>
			<p id="1fd1831a-4c5c-80d1-8ca2-d1a4d2880821" class="">The weighting scheme assigns a weight factor for each
				constituent security in the index. Weighting schemes include: (i) market capitalization, (ii) price,
				(iii) equal, (iv) risk (inverse volatility), and (v) factor-tilted (e.g., value, volatility, and
				fundamentals). The choice of weighting scheme has important consequences for the index. Market cap
				weighting results in concentration in the largest securities and decrease diversification, whereas equal
				weighting diversifies the index but the market leaders may outperform the smaller laggards. </p>
			<h3 id="2141831a-4c5c-80d1-905a-e5132b2cd8ee" class="">Rebalancing Schedule</h3>
			<p id="1fd1831a-4c5c-8071-9001-c3ee778f6f0e" class="">Each index must determine how often it updates its
				weighting schedule and the components of the index. The frequency may be daily, monthly, quarterly,
				semi-annual, annual or never. The rebalancing schedule may be according to fixed set of rules for the
				index or determined by active managers. Rebalancing results in (i) costs, and (ii) turnover with an
				increased frequency eliciting trading fees but also a closer adherence to the index. The rebalancing
				scheme may include buffers so that securities that fall just the index threshold are not eliminated just
				to be replaced in the next cycle if price recovers. Buffers minimize whipsaws and costs of eliminating
				one security to purchase a new position. Reference dates determine how long the look-back period is for
				rebalancing; the reference dates may be the average volume or snapshots at a set time.</p>
			<h3 id="2141831a-4c5c-8041-b291-d53c8539522e" class="">Handling of Corporate Actions</h3>
			<p id="1fd1831a-4c5c-80c2-9511-c13226020ad5" class="">Corporate actions impact holdings through dividends,
				splits, spin-offs, mergers and acquisitions, rights, etc. Mishandling corporate actions in the index may
				result in artificial jumps or distort index adherence to its definitions. An obvious corporate action
				that affects the index is the receipt of dividends from a stock and, similarly, interest from a bond. A
				stock goes ex-dividend, reducing the price by dividend amount. The dividend is later paid as cash. The
				index may chose to “reinvest” the dividend in the stock by increasing the number of shares.
				Alternatively, they may ignore the dividend. Split ratios are defined by the corporate action and the
				share count changes occur after the market close of business on split date. The index may chose to add
				both parent and child stocks in a spin-off or just keep the parent. </p>

			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8017-9ca3-e2ef51929814" class="">Indices are fundamental to markets. They help provide
				a measure for performance that shapes how investors make decisions, particularly related to risk
				allowances. The establishment of a trusted index is necessary to expand trading into new asset classes.
				Creating benchmarks for crypto assets is the next step for the space to become sufficiently established.
