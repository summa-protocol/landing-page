			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-81a2-b447-dd3d66225935" class="">This paper introduces, for a general audience, the
				concept of <strong>pooled investing</strong> through mutual funds and exchange-traded funds or products
				(<strong>ETFs</strong>), highlighting why these “basket” products have become essential tools for
				investors. The paper tracks the <strong>major milestones</strong> in the evolution of passive investing
				and describes the <strong>key benefits</strong> of pooled investment: diversification, increased
				liquidity of basket constituents, cost efficiency, and accessibility. We wrap up with important
				<strong>opportunities for improvement</strong> in ETF markets.</p>

				not broadly discussed are 5.1 and 6.3.</p>
			<h2 id="1fc1831a-4c5c-807b-8bde-ff8095bb9560" class="">1. Executive Summary</h2>
			<p id="1fc1831a-4c5c-807d-975a-e7793017c6b1" class=""><strong>Pooled investing </strong>through mutual funds
				and exchange-traded funds or products (ETFs) provides investors multiple benefits: (i) diversification
				across a selected category (growth or value; equity or bond; sectors); (ii) increased liquidity for
				pooled investment and basket constituents; (iii) cost efficiency; and (iv) ease of purchase.</p>
			<p id="1fc1831a-4c5c-807d-81f3-ee9fa196a051" class="">Mutual Funds provide pooled investing but minimal
				tools for active trading. ETFs are tradable throughout market hours with a redeem/create function
				performed by market makers to keep ETF value close to NAV. Tools for active trading (futures, margin,
				and continuous trading) are widely available; the costs to transact and fees are generally lower than
				mutual funds.</p>
			<p id="1fe1831a-4c5c-80e0-9ddb-d884ad141827" class="">Nonetheless, ETFs have ample room for improvement. In
				this paper, we sketch out a few, primarily methods such as improving creation/redemption mechanisms and
				tick size that will save investors and issuers money.</p>
			<p id="1fe1831a-4c5c-8025-91a6-efbbc079ff3f" class="">The sections we believe are the most interesting and
				not broadly discussed are <strong>5.1</strong> and <strong>6.3</strong>. </p>
			<h2 id="1fb1831a-4c5c-81c9-9b73-cef6efe4883d" class="">2. Financial Market Fundamentals</h2>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8165-8ba7-e81b841edc0f" class="">Equities, debt instruments, and futures are among the
				oldest financial tools, forming the backbone of modern markets. Equities (a share of ownership of a
				company with rights to residual profits and voting on company management) date back to the 1602 initial
				public offering (IPO) of the Dutch East India Company (Ferguson); debt instruments (interest paying
				loans and bonds) have existed since ancient Mesopotamia (Green); and futures (agreements for delayed
				purchase at given prices) trace to medieval European grain markets and 17th-century Japan (Bell et al.).
				Equities provide ownership while debt provides rights to cash flow and futures hedge the price and cash
				flows; thus, these instruments underpin today’s global financial system, enabling capital formation and
				risk management at scale.</p>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8167-8a39-cfc8570e2d3e" class="">Nonetheless, these products may not suitable for the
				majority of individual investors. Even professional active managers of mutual funds rarely outperform
				the Standard and Poors (S&amp;P) 500 index. Successfully picking individual equities requires ample
				understanding of company fundamentals, prospects, management, and exposes investors to market risks
				(Great Financial Crisis of 2008) and irrational decision making due to fear or greed. Evaluating the
				trustworthiness of debtors and performance of futures is even more difficult, with even the most
				sophisticated investors regularly failing to outperform <a
					href="indices2.html">markets</a>.
				(Kosowski et al.; Griffin et al.) </p>
			<h2 id="1fb1831a-4c5c-81b9-abe1-c2c73e2a28c2" class="">3. Mutual Funds</h2>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8189-9f42-c13f082970cb" class="">The first asset managers observed the above challenges
				investors faced and realized they could encourage the participation of risk-averse individuals in
				financial markets and earn fees by offering diversification-as-a-service. Consequently, the first mutual
				funds were issued in Amsterdam in the 1770s, allowing small investors to pool their assets while wealth
				managers scaled their roles (i) creating and rebalancing portfolios, (ii) conducting market research,
				(iii) developing novel strategies. Mutual funds now target all different investor objectives such as
				growth, income, or sector concentration.</p>
			<h3 id="1fe1831a-4c5c-8020-8a14-dec8f4855709" class="">3.1 Closed-End Funds</h3>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-81e0-908a-cb9c5fea8aec" class="">Although mutual funds generally improved results for
				investors compared with investing in individual stocks or bonds, these early forms of mutual funds came
				with challenges. The first pooled-investment vehicles were closed-end mutual funds (CEF), which raise
				funds through an IPO and issue a fixed number of shares that trade on exchanges; the CEF may raise
				additional funds by borrowing funds and/or issuing additional shares. Because the share count of CEF
				funds is generally fixed, the CEF share prices float with supply and demand and routinely deviates from
				net asset value (NAV). During market turmoil, the discount widens and investors may have difficulty
				obtaining a reasonable price for their CEF shares. (Lee, Schleifer, and Thaler) Compliance and
				management fees (including interest charges for leverage) are often much higher than “open-end” mutual
				funds.</p>
			<h3 id="1fe1831a-4c5c-8037-9ae5-df7462617414" class="">3.2 Open-End Funds</h3>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8028-88d5-cedca8bb9b4e" class="">The first “<a
					href="https://www.fundguard.com/100-years-of-mutual-funds/">open-end</a>” mutual fund—one able to be
				redeemed for cash or underlying shares—was created in the United States in 1924. Because the shares are
				redeemable at NAV, investors must sell their shares during market hours and then receive the NAV at the
				close of trading. To meet redemptions, mutual fund managers maintain a liquidity buffer, resulting in
				impaired performance compared with a fully invested portfolio. In addition, many mutual funds used
				front-end and/or back-end loads to increase their fees and incentivize investors to keep their
				investments. The compliance and management costs for mutual funds are high as well as the trading costs
				through brokerages. </p>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8182-99c4-d952959b8a96" class="">Mutual funds allowed more investors to diversify their
				portfolios. The stock-market crash of 1929 spurred federal oversight; the <strong>Investment Company Act
					of 1940</strong>, enforced by the newly formed SEC, codified disclosure rules, leverage limits, and
				fiduciary duties for all U.S. investment companies. Fueled by a growing middle class saving for
				retirement, U.S. mutual-fund assets ballooned from about <strong>$135 billion in 1980 to roughly $5
					trillion by the late 1990s</strong>, cementing pooled investing as a cornerstone of personal
				finance.</p>
			<blockquote id="1fb1831a-4c5c-807f-b523-d6a71bdf34bb" class="">Most institutional and individual investors
				will find the best way to own common stock is through an index fund that charges minimal fees. Those
				following this path are sure to beat the net results delivered by the great majority of investment
				professionals.<br />— Warren Buffett<br /></blockquote>
			<h2 id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8198-bb70-df66041b84ff" class="">4. Exchange-Traded Products</h2>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8119-9a02-f4e815b2a33e" class="">Mutual funds, particularly open-end funds, were widely
				successful, but as described above exhibited high fees and are only redeemable once per day. These two
				factors limited their use cases to long-term buy-and-hold strategies. To address these two factors and
				thereby improve tradability, exchange-traded funds or products (ETPs) were developed in the 1990s. State
				Street developed the first such fund: the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust with the ticker SPY. </p>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8177-8981-f3a37a4c10f6" class="">The differences between mutual funds and ETFs are

				<a href="https://www.schwab.com/etfs/mutual-funds-vs-etfs">here</a>, and <a
					href="https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/which-is-right-for-you">here</a>,
				for instance) but to understand the benefits (and eventual points of improvement) related to ETFs, we
				focus on select aspects of their differences.</p>
			<h3 id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8123-a707-f0f30a967078" class="">4.1 ETFs Trade Freely on Exchanges</h3>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8138-8318-ec243ddea5cf" class="">ETFs are tradable and have continuous liquidity
				throughout market hours, allowing investors to enter or exit positions at will (and according to market
				maker quotes). This near-constant liquidity allows for instantaneous responses to news, model changes,
				rebalancing needs and development of futures products for leveraged investing. Pensions and hedge funds
				alike invest in ETF-products, not mutual funds. </p>
			<h3 id="1fb1831a-4c5c-81c2-a3da-ca8854aa0167" class="">4.2 ETFs Exhibit Lower Costs Than Mutual Funds</h3>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8137-a839-d27ae643a63f" class="">ETFs usually charge lower management fees than mutual
				funds for several reasons, but the primary one is the <strong>Creation/Redemption</strong> mechanism.
				Briefly we will discuss this difference. In a mutual fund, an investor enters a position and then the
				managers take the investor money and use it to buy securities that make up the fund (underlyings). Since
				trading must be conducted at NAV in a mutual fund, the time available for a mutual fund to conduct such
				a purchase is limited, explaining why trading can only occur once per day (e.g. if a NAV is marked at
				the closing auction, underlying purchases can only be done in the closing auction). The reverse occurs
				with investors hoping to sell/redeem the fund. The costs of the buy and sell trades, compliance, taxes,
				and management are all charged to all investors of the fund.</p>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-805d-a8a5-e9e4f2e1fc60" class="">In ETFs, market makers provide liquidity continuously.
				If there is sufficient investor demand to increase the number of shares outstanding of an ETF, then the
				market maker will conduct all underlying transactions to seed the additional shares (a creation). The
				redemption of ETF shares occurs when sufficient investor selling occurs. Market makers frequently can
				conduct trades at significantly lower costs than mutual funds, saving ETF investors money. Other times,
				when flows negate each other or are relatively low, they obviate the need to conduct a
				creation/redemption.</p>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-81db-9212-f50ad995b33b" class="">Mutual funds publish their specific fees in their
				prospectuses and provide historical fee data. ETF investors pay fees in the form of <strong>variable
					bid/ask spreads</strong> because ETFs trade on exchanges. To exit a position, an investor needs to
				hit a bid; to enter, an investor needs to lift an offer. The creation/redemption mechanism keeps these
				values generally close to NAVs, but <strong>transactions may occur away from the theoretical
					value</strong> of the sum of ETF constituents. In some cases, spreads and <strong>premia
					(discounts)</strong> from NAV make trading prohibitively expensive. A future article will discuss
				the mechanisms of ETFs in greater detail.</p>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-81fb-8803-edab39e0b4ac" class="">Suffice to say, ETFs function sufficiently well to
				allow for both long- and short-term trading. These pooled investment products are so valuable that they
				have created a multi-trillion dollar global industry, showing marked acceptance and utility. These ETFs
				hold significant assets under management, make up 10% of market capitalization on US exchanges, and 30%
				of daily trading volumes (Ben-David et al.). The advent of ETFs has benefited the resulting ecosystem of
				index providers, issuers, market makers, investors, and extensive intermediary teams. Below, we discuss
				how ETF trading trends have shaped markets.</p>
			<h3 id="1ff1831a-4c5c-80bf-96a7-efaf09a56437" class="">4.3 Creation/Redemption</h3>
			<p id="49137f51-cea6-449e-a85d-eb22b32e7bcb" class="">The creation/redemption mechanism helps ensure that an
				ETF&#x27;s market price stays close to its net asset value (NAV). Authorized Participants (APs),
				typically large financial institutions, can create new ETF shares by delivering the underlying assets or
				redeem shares by exchanging them for those assets. If the ETF is trading above its NAV, APs can buy the
				underlying assets, create ETF shares, and sell them at the higher market price, profiting from the
				difference and pushing the price back toward NAV. If the ETF is trading below its NAV, they can buy the
				ETF shares at a discount, redeem them for the more valuable underlying assets, and sell those, again
				profiting and nudging the price up. This arbitrage process helps maintain price alignment between the
				ETF and the value of its holdings. Without it, ETFs could drift significantly from the value of what
				they actually represent.</p>
			<p id="1ff1831a-4c5c-8092-aef8-c3ad7df6389e" class="">In other words, market makers “buy low, sell high”
				with creations/redemptions representing upper bounds for purchase/lower bounds for sale. Competitive
				markets push prices towards these levels which are basically NAV plus/minus some fees.</p>
			<h2 id="1fb1831a-4c5c-814e-bd8c-f51f2017c05d" class="">5. ETFs Improve Markets of their Underlying
				Components</h2>
			<p id="1fe1831a-4c5c-8051-a33e-e60be24acbc0" class="">Parsing the impact of ETPs on trading habits in
				general is a challenging academic exercise. Whether they exacerbate volatility, increase correlation in
				assets, or improve price discovery is hard to answer (though there are many attempts in the literature
				[this <a
					href="https://www.blackrock.com/au/education/ishares/etf-frequently-asked-questions">article</a>
				cites a few]), but it is clear ETFs are one of the most important innovations in financial markets in
				recent memory. In this section, we discuss some ways ETFs have shaped markets.</p>
			<h3 id="1fb1831a-4c5c-816d-a509-d24edc7b4d47" class="">5.1 Corporate Debt</h3>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-816a-826b-d9c2a5e1bdd1" class="">Bonds and other types of debt typically trade in
				over-the-counter transactions, making them inaccessible to most investors. ETFs led to a paradigm shift
				in bond market access. As Samara Cohen, Chief Investment Officer of Index Funds at BlackRock, said
				during the <a href="https://youtu.be/cX3TBqtPchs?si=ymYxwHz0rKYscA7B">Ondo Summit in 2025</a>,
				<strong>“You can’t have a credible conversation in the bond market without knowing what an ETF
					is.”</strong></p>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8158-b5f8-e7d97b6a4a0b" class="">While there are around 4000 distinct stocks, there are
				millions of bonds. Banks around the world help corporations fund their businesses through debt, with
				each issuance to each corporation having unique term sheets and underlying risk factors. The breadth of
				the bond market and the amount of due diligence required to pick winning bonds is difficult even for the
				most specialized investors, resulting in illiquid markets for individual bonds.</p>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8104-89f9-ea2a1b8cada2" class="">To increase investor access to these important debt
				instruments, that in turn reduces the cost of capital for corporations (and similarly municipal debt),
				asset managers have increasingly turned to the ETF market. Beginning in 2002 with iShares iBoxx $
				Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD), the fixed income ETF market has grown considerably in value
				and breadth, encouraging greater market sophistication. Total US fixed income ETF assets have doubled in
				the past five years.</p>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8180-94f7-f44807f03fcd" class="">Those historically trading debt instruments benefited
				from from strong relationships with debt issuers and high degrees of fragmentation. Now, high frequency
				trading firms are entering the market and dominating the ETF bond market space. As a result, <strong>the
					ecosystem is rapidly changing, with spreads tightening</strong> and more entrants flocking to the
				space. These changes benefit everyone in the debt ecosystem except the old guard who took rents from
				market inefficiencies, with institutions like <a

			<h3 id="1fb1831a-4c5c-81b6-93b0-cef371bb1c37" class="">5.2 Bitcoin and Ethereum</h3>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-81af-ad18-e8ee21483369" class="">Starting January 10, 2024, Bitcoin could be traded on
				exchange for the first time in an ETP wrapper. Unlike most ETPs, these products don’t exist to allow for
				passive investing, diversification, or exposure to active management; they are important simply because
				they allow investors who are restricted to equity investing, or those who do not want to interact
				directly on-chain, to receive exposure to the exciting opportunities in crypto assets.</p>
			<p id="1fe1831a-4c5c-8005-9b35-c16abbda0b89" class="">When crypto ETPs were listed, markets demonstrated an
				interesting phenomenon: while crypto fundamentals had not changed in the slightest, the price of Bitcoin
				soared. Simply creating an ETP product unlocked liquidity, impacting the crypto market similar to the
				changes seen over years in debt markets. (Shalvardjiev) Ethereum markets demonstrated these dynamics to
				a lesser extent, but we predict that as ETPs enable investments into new markets such as tokenized RWAs,
				we will see similar dynamics as pent up demand is able to be released.</p>
			<h2 id="1fb1831a-4c5c-806f-bacd-f9d7777b3aca" class="">6. New Frontiers for ETFs</h2>
			<h3 id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8134-9485-e1fbe7aee2db" class="">6.1 Improving Global ETF Access</h3>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-81a6-9fae-ddd1e2b2c852" class="">For the most part, ETFs are only available in their
				country of origin due to exchange access. In Europe, investors hoping to buy local funds tracking the
				S&amp;P 500 need to pay higher fees to purchase SPY or IVV. If Europeans buy local S&amp;P 500 ETF
				shares, they purchase Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (<a
					href="ucits.html">UCITS</a>)
				like CSPX LN, but CSPX LN has higher fees than US based counterparts despite functioning practically
				identically. </p>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8170-a323-c99185e5db0e" class="">Not every market even has access to UCITS or ability
				to trade funds when exchanges are open, limiting trading. To truly democratize finance by making markets
				more efficient and by allocating funds to the optimal opportunities, ETFs must be traded 24/7 and
				globally. Unfortunately, traditional finance rails do not allow for these opportunities.</p>
			<h3 id="1fb1831a-4c5c-817d-9c0d-e4fc3b44fc78" class="">6.2 Increasing Fractionalization by Lowering Tick
				Size</h3>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-81fd-a8db-f88420c72999" class="">In US markets, the smallest price increment an ETF is
				$0.01. Other markets have similar restrictions. For some funds, this minimum increment can represent a
				significant cost. If identical funds have a handle of $10 and $100, a one cent price increment
				represents 10 bps versus 1 bp to cross the spread and enter/exit the position. We discuss how this
				spread represents a significant cost for investors in our article on BTC (the ETF) trading.</p>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-80a1-8557-f6dfd1ad8526" class="">Crypto exchanges support significantly smaller tick
				sizes, allowing for better pricing and therefore easier trading of funds. While liquid funds now
				frequently trade “touch/touch” (the bid/ask spread is one cent), we predict funds will not always trade
				at the smallest pricing increment on-chain, making efficient pricing precision far more important for
				traders than the current race-to-the-bottom in terms of speed that blocks new entrants from joining
				markets.</p>
			<h3 id="1fb1831a-4c5c-81f8-b67d-e27894a51589" class="">6.3 Reducing ETF Tracking Error</h3>
			<figure id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8107-ad53-d895ebd3feea" class="image"><a href="/assets/images/ETF_Primer/jnkTrackingError.png"><img
						style="width:709.9937744140625px" src="/assets/images/ETF_Primer/jnkTrackingError.png" /></a></figure>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8115-b487-ee72eafb309e" class="">It took over a decade for ETFs in the illiquid bond
				market to obtain a similar tracking error to that in equity market ETFs. ETFs like JNK (as shown above),
				have trended over time to a relatively stable range. Some products will never achieve such tight

			<p id="1fe1831a-4c5c-8041-97af-d505c59ccc09" class="">Beyond equities, futures, and debt, some creative
				issuers have added new products. The rapidly growing space of buffer ETFs, for instance, includes
				options. For the most part, options are exchange traded, making price replication fairly easy, but many
				funds hold what are called “flex” options. These options are not exchange traded, meaning that matching
				their price is very hard, as we see below in the premium/discount chart for one such fund, BMAY.</p>

			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-811d-8f1d-f738911c2fb6" class="">Other funds hold swaps on indices that are not easy to
				discern publicly, such as BDRY, which is a pool of swaps on shipping contracts.</p>

			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-811a-b080-caae207fdf10" class="">Both of these products have generally fine liquidity
				and trade at penny spreads, but have large swings in premia/discounts reflecting market making costs to
				enter/exit their position. <strong>These swings represent another investor cost in ETPs,</strong> as
				valuation swings can act against positions.</p>
			<p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-81d3-b042-c8890e6f13d1" class="">The above funds are relatively complex, but Bitcoin
				and Ethereum funds are very simple, with orders of magnitude fewer components than SPY and JNK. Even
				though the underlying components are exchange-traded, these funds trade at significant premia/discounts
				since an on-chain asset is being wrapped off-chain with associated price uncertainty. Below, we can see
				the premium/discount chart for USDU (an ETF with thirteen currency underlyings) and IBIT (an ETF with
				just one currency underlying, Bitcoin).</p>

At first, investors might relate these swings to the significant volatility of Bitcoin, but since market makers are hedged, volatility has no impact on premia/discounts (volatility impacts spreads, but IBIT and USDU both trade touch/touch). The true reasoning for this relatively high tracking error is a function of the creation/redemption mechanism. For now, we will suffice to say by improving this mechanism, we can improve the pricing efficiency.</p><p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-813c-a628-ccb0affe0e39" class="">IBIT and other ETFs of its ilk like BITB and ETHA are the most simple possible crypto funds. As more complex funds are developed—such as a CoinDesk 20 ETF (see our paper on the importance of <a href="indices2.html">indices</a>)—the divergence from fair value will only increase. In the coming weeks, we will lay out our plans of how we can tighten this gap.</p><h3 id="1fb1831a-4c5c-819b-a26a-f95a7e171b88" class="">6.4 New Assets</h3><p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-811e-b07f-ff76b80c0670" class="">As more assets get tokenized to reduce intermediary costs, we imagine that ETFs will be the tool necessary to help them achieve huge boosts in liquidity as with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and corporate debt. Organizations like BlackRock and Apollo are increasingly adopting blockchain technology to reduce their costs by partnering with organizations like Ondo and Plume to put their assets on chain. To fully utilize these assets and create new markets, we imagine issuers will want to issue ETFs. However, we do not want these products to be overly costly due to challenges for market makers, as with IBIT and BDRY alike. This means that companies like Ondo cannot succeed in improving ETFs by making a tokenized version of SPY, as the difference between TradFi and DeFi rails will lead to high costs. We believe the solution lies on chain, as we will sketch out in future articles.</p><h2 id="1fb1831a-4c5c-8128-814b-df2f9975dc0a" class="">7. Conclusion</h2><p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-81d9-9168-c47b5235846b" class="">For centuries, financial markets have continually enhanced mechanisms for increased efficient and cost-effective allocations of capital, from fixed income to equity to futures. As markets became more efficient, cost-effective, and with tools for diversification, more people could afford and were willing to become investors. We see this impact of this hurdle through the success of mutual funds and eventually ETPs. However, we posit that pooled investing still has room to evolve, particularly as more assets and ETFs move onto blockchains. Over the coming months, we will expand on this thesis and provide an explanation of our solution.</p><h2 id="1fb1831a-4c5c-818b-ba04-cabd9a1932f7" class="">References</h2><p id="1fb1831a-4c5c-80c1-9689-e3a938b9629d" class="">Bell, Adrian, Brooks, Chris, Dryburgh, Paul. <em>Interest rates and efficiency in medieval wool forward contracts.
