              This paper is intended for those without a strong finance
              background to understand the benefits of passive investing and
              major milestones in its development. This is not a technical paper
              in any way, but should be helpful in understanding why investors
              choose passive products. In the following sections, we show why
              basket products like mutual funds and ETPs are significant unlocks
              in liquidity of underlyings, why each development in passive
              investing has proved significant, and where we envision the space
              will move.

              Equities, futures, and debt instruments are among the oldest
              financial tools, forming the backbone of modern markets. Equities
              (a share of ownership of a company) date back to the 1602 IPO of
              the Dutch East India Company; debt (interest paying) instruments
              like loans and bonds have existed since ancient Mesopotamia; and
              futures (agreements for delayed purchase at given prices) trace to
              17th-century Japan. These instruments underpin today’s global
              financial system, enabling capital formation and risk management
              at massive scale.

              Nonetheless, these products have long been known to be unsuitable
              for the majority of investors. Successfully picking individual
              equities, for instance, requires ample understanding of company
              fundamentals and exposes investors to idiosyncratic risks. Within
              five years of the listing of the Dutch East India Company,
              Shakespeare wrote his cautionary tale—<em
                >The Merchant of Venice—</em
              >about the dangers of concentrating wealth in specific companies
              (the conflict of the story arises from a failed investment in
              merchant ventures, similar to investing in the Dutch East India
              Company). Evaluating the trustworthiness of debtors and
              performance of futures proves no easier, with even the most
              sophisticated investors regularly failing to outperform
              <a href="index-primer.html">markets</a>. (Kosowski et al.; Griffin

              Even those with access to capital often avoided financial markets
              due to their inherent risks. Recognizing an untapped market, asset
              managers realized that they could earn massive fees by offering
              diversification-as-a-service. As a result, the first mutual funds
              were issued in Amsterdam in the 1770s. These investment vehicles
              offered huge advantages over individual security picking. They
              allowed small investors to pool their wealth which enabled
              managers to scale their efforts to conduct market research, build
              and rebalance portfolios, and develop new strategies.

              Individual investors benefited from growing market segments, not
              needing to decide on individual equities, bonds, or futures. They
              simply specify their objectives—growth, income, exposure to
              healthcare, etc.—and fund managers are happy to identify or create
              a product, allowing each to profit in ways neither could before.

              These early forms of mutual funds came with a notable downside,
              namely that shares were not easily tendered for cash when
              investors wanted to pull their money, resulting in significant
              fees for those who needed liquidity. The first “<a
                href="https://www.fundguard.com/100-years-of-mutual-funds/"
                >open-end</a
              >” mutual fund—one able to be redeemed for cash or underlying
              shares—was created in the United States in 1924. Once per day,
              investors could trade their shares at net asset value (NAV),
              unlocking huge efficiency gains and investor interest compared to
              close-end counterparts (Lee, Schleifer, and Thaler).

              Open-end mutual funds allowed for vastly larger shares of the
              population to achieve easy diversification even before a clear
              regulatory framework was developed. The Great Depression resulted
              in the creation of the SEC and the Investment Company Act of 1940
              which defined how these funds could trade. Over the following
              forty years, with a burgeoning middle class saving for retirement
              in indices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the mutual
              fund market ballooned from hundreds of millions of dollars to
              hundreds of billions by the 1980s. The market for passive
              investing had ample room to grow.

              Mutual funds were a booming business, but they were fairly limited
              in their use cases, mainly for long-term buy-and-hold strategies
              such as retirement funds, as they are frequently used today. In
              the 1990s, a far better alternative was developed that allowed
              passive investing to grow to the multi-trillion dollar industry it
              is today: exchange-traded products (ETPs).

              Building on the success of the mutual fund industry, savvy
              managers at State Street developed the first such fund: the SPDR
              S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust with the ticker SPY. This fund
              revolutionized passive investing, giving access to the broad
              performance of US markets with the addition of high liquidity and
              cheap fees. SPY’s success has led to ETP investing to reach the
              heights of tens of trillions of dollars in trading. To understand
              the reason for this explosion in assets under management, we need
              to understand the differences between mutual funds and ETFs which
              is described below.

              There are more exhaustive discussions of the differences between
              these two types of products, but to understand the benefits (and
              eventual points of improvement) related to ETPs, we can winnow
              down to a few very specific aspects of their differences.
            </p>

              By trading on exchange, ETPs are able to have continuous liquidity
              throughout market hours. As long as a market maker is willing to
              buy or sell the fund, investors can enter or exit positions at
              will. For retail investors, this creates a much lower hurdle to
              enter passive markets, as brokerages like Robinhood do not offer
              mutual fund investments and high minimum costs on other brokerages
              provide frictions to invest. For institutional investors,
              near-constant liquidity allows for instantaneous responses to
              news, model changes, and rebalancing needs. Pensions and hedge
              funds alike invest in ETPs, not mutual funds. Access is an
              important reason for the growth of passive investing, but it is
              only half the picture.
            </p>

              As stated above, ETPs usually charge lower management fees for
              many reasons, but the primary one is a feature known as the
              Creation/Redemption mechanism. We will discuss this topic in
              another piece in the future, but for now we will provide a brief
              explanation here. When an investor enters a position in a mutual
              fund, the managers take the investor money and use it to buy
              shares of the underlying fund. Since trading must be conducted at
              NAV in a mutual fund, the time available for a mutual fund to
              conduct such a purchase is limited, explaining why trading can
              only occur once per day (NAV values are only calculated once per
              day, with exact measurement dependent on fund prospectuses). These
              trades include all of the underlying costs that investors must pay
              when purchasing an ETP, which are then passed on to end users. For
              ETPs however, market makers provide liquidity continuously. If
              there is sufficient investor demand to increase the number of
              shares outstanding of an ETP (a creation), then the market maker
              will conduct all underlying transactions to seed more shares.
              Market makers frequently can conduct these trades at significantly
              lower costs than mutual funds can, saving end investors money.
              Other times, when flows negate each other or relatively low, they
              obviate the need to conduct a creation/redemption in general.
            </p>
            <p id="1df1831a-4c5c-8078-a26d-fd68b2164c37" class="">
              Nonetheless, mutual funds announce their specific fees in their
              prospectuses, which allow investors to have a deterministic view
              of costs. Conversely, because ETPs trade on exchange, investors
              are exposed to fees in the form of variable bid/ask spreads. To
              exit a position, an investor needs to hit a bid; to enter, an
              investor needs to lift an offer. The creation/redemption mechanism
              keeps these values generally close to NAVs, but for a variety of
              reasons, transactions can occur away from the theoretical value of
              the sum of ETP underlyings. In some cases, these fees can make
              trading prohibitive, but again this is a topic for a future
              article.

              Suffice to say, ETPs function sufficiently well to allow for both
              long- and short-term trading. These passive investment products
              are so valuable that they have created a multi-trillion dollar
              global industry on their own, showing the strides passive
              investing has made since the 1980s before the first ETPs were
              created. These funds do not merely contain significant assets
              under management, but make up 10% of market capitalization on US
              exchanges and 30% of daily trading volumes (Ben-David et al.). The
              resulting ecosystem of index providers, ETP issuers, market
              makers, investors, and extensive intermediary teams has become
              very wealthy. Below, we discuss how ETP trading trends have shaped
              markets.

              Parsing the impact of ETPs on trading habits in general is a
              challenging academic exercise. Whether they exacerbate volatility,
              increase correlation in assets, or improve price discovery is hard
              to answer (though there are many attempts in the literature), but
              it is clear ETPs are one of the most important innovations in
              financial markets in recent memory. In the US, ETPs make up 20% of
              all short interest and account for a significant portion of
              trading volumes. More importantly, they have transformed markets.

              Bonds and other types of debt typically trade in over-the-counter
              transactions, making them inaccessible to most investors. ETPs led
              to a paradigm shift in market access. As Samara Cohen, Chief

              Where there are around 4000 distinct stocks, there are millions of
              bonds. Banks around the country help corporations fund their
              businesses through debt, with each issuance having unique term
              sheets and underlying risk factors. The amount of diligence
              required to pick winning bonds is impractical for even the most
              specialized investors. For this reason, individual bonds are

              To increase investor access to these important instruments, which

              Starting January 10, 2024, Bitcoin could be traded on exchange for
              the first time in an ETP wrapper. Unlike most ETPs, these products
              don’t exist to allow for passive investing, diversification, or
              exposure to active management; they are important simply because
              they allow investors who are restricted to equity investing, or
              those who do not want to interact directly on-chain, to receive
              exposure to the exciting opportunities in crypto assets.

              When crypto ETPs were able to be listed, markets demonstrated an
              interesting phenomenon: while crypto fundamentals had not changed
              in the slightest, the price of Bitcoin soared. Simply creating an
              ETP product unlocked liquidity, impacting the crypto market
              similar to the changes seen over years in debt markets.
              (Shalvardjiev) Ethereum markets demonstrated these dynamics to a
              lesser extent, but we predict that as ETPs enable investments into
              new markets, we will see similar dynamics as pent up demand is
              able to be released.

              For the most part, ETPs are only available in their country of
              origin due to exchange access. In Europe, investors hoping to buy
              local funds tracking the S&amp;P 500 need to pay higher fees to
              purchase SPY or IVV. If they want to buy local shares, they
              purchase UCITS (we will have a brief article on these shortly)
              like CSPX LN which have higher fees than US based counterparts
              despite functioning near identically. To proceed with trades,
              investors need to stomach these extra fees, preventing trades that
              issuers, market makers, and end investors would all prefer.

              Not every market even has access to UCITS or ability to trade
              funds when exchanges are open, all preventing valuable trading. In
              order to truly democratize finance, making markets more efficient
              by allocating funds to the optimal opportunities, ETPs need to be
              able to be traded 24/7 and globally. Unfortunately, traditional
              finance rails do not allow for these opportunities.

              In US markets, the smallest price increment an ETP can be quoted
              is $0.01. Other markets have similar restrictions. Even if the
              tick size were reduced, for some funds this can represent a
              significant cost. Take for instance the fund BTC. This was spun
              off from Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETP, GBTC, in order to allow smaller
              investors to purchase Bitcoin “<a
                href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/22/grayscale-mini-ether-etf-big-mac"
                >for the price of hamburger</a
              >” (the fund started with NAV around $5). This fund had lower fees
              than its bigger counterpart, encouraging investment. Nonetheless,
              institutional traders would not invest in this fund because the
              cost of purchasing a single share was around 20 bps, a significant
              cost compared to the 1 bp or so fee of GBTC at the time. We will
              discuss this example further, but for now we can comment that the
              significantly smaller tick size on crypto exchange will allow for
              better pricing and therefore easier trading of funds. While liquid
              funds now frequently trade “touch/touch” (the bid/ask spread is
              one cent), we predict funds will not trade at the smallest pricing
              increment on-chain, making efficient pricing far more important
              for traders than the current race-to-the-bottom in terms of speed
              that blocks new entrants from joining markets.

              It took over a decade for the illiquid bond market to receive
              close to the same tracking error that we see in equity markets.
              While there are days when the premium/discount blows out on ETPs
              like JNK as shown above, they have collapsed to a relatively
              stable range. The rails of traditional finance support such trends
              for ETPs with underlyings that trade on exchange. However, certain
              underlying products cannot achieve the same level of liquidity,
              ensuring that closing prices never converge to tight levels like
              those of SPY and JNK.

              ETPs can hold practically anything. Equities, futures, and debt
              are common, but some issuers get more creative. One of the fastest
              growing ETP spaces currently is buffer funds. These funds cap
              downside by holding options. For the most part, options are
              exchange traded, making price replication fairly easy, but many
              funds hold what are called “flex” options. These are not exchange
              traded, meaning that matching their price is very hard, as we see

              because all transactions are managed by fund advisors, so to
              effectively unlock liquidity using ETPs, both the spread and

              The above funds are relatively complex, but Bitcoin and Ethereum
              funds are around as simple as it gets, with orders of magnitude
              fewer components necessary to price relative to SPY and JNK. Even
              though the underlying components are exchange-traded, these funds

              As we can see from these two graphs, IBIT trades at far greater
              premia and discounts than USDU, even though it trades at
              significantly higher volumes. While it might seem that this price
              discrepancy is related to the volatility of Bitcoin, market makers
              are theoretically always hedged, making volatility unimportant for
              the premia/discounts (volatility should only impact spread, with
              both ETPs generally trading at the tightest levels possible on
              exchange). The true reasoning for this relatively high tracking
              error is a function of the creation/redemption mechanism. For now,
              we will suffice to say by improving this mechanism, we can improve

              As more assets get tokenized to reduce intermediary costs, we
              imagine that ETPs will be the tool necessary to help them achieve
              huge boosts in liquidity as with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and corporate
              debt. Organizations like BlackRock and Apollo are increasingly
              adopting blockchain technology to reduce their costs by partnering
              with organizations like Ondo and Plume to put their assets on
              chain. To fully utilize these assets and create new markets, we
              imagine issuers will need to issue ETPs. However, we do not want
              these products to be overly costly due to lack of ability for
              market makers to trade them, as with IBIT and BDRY alike. This
              means that companies like Ondo cannot succeed in improving ETPs by
              making a tokenized version of SPY, as the difference between
              TradFi and DeFi rails will lead to higher costs as we saw with
              IBIT. We believe the solution lies on chain, as we will sketch out

              For centuries, financial markets have ensured efficient
              allocations of capital, from fixed income to equity to futures.
              The riskiness of these assets prevented their widespread adoption
              of a public willing to invest. We see this impact of this hurdle
              through the success of mutual funds and eventually ETPs. Beyond
              encouraging diversification, passive investment vehicles have also
              resulted in markets growing increasingly efficient, reducing costs
              for the entire economies. A tangible benefit of these savings is
              more financial stability and greater savings for retirees.
              However, we believe that passive investing still has room to
              evolve, particularly as more assets move on chain. Over the coming
              months, we will expand on this thesis and provide an explanation
              of our solution.
