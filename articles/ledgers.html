              Definition and Evolution of Ledgers

              A ledger is a structured chronological record of transactions that
              documents transfers of assets from one owner/entity/wallet to
              another. Deconstructing the ledger transactions determines the
              organization’s balance sheet (assets and liabilities) as well as
              profit-loss over a selected timeframe. Ledgers are a
              record-keeping system for accounting. Initially, ledgers were a
              list of transactions entered manually and chronologically into a
              book (book-keeping). However, a typographical error is difficult
              to detect in a single-entry, manual ledger, which led to
              double-entry accounting where each economic event (e.g., purchase
              or sale) is recorded in at at least two ledger accounts: once as a
              debit and then a matching credit transaction. Debits must equal
              credits to balance the books.

              Manual accounting evolved into the use of linked spreadsheets,
              then relational databases (Quickbooks, Peachtree, and Xero).
              Accounting for enterprises with multiple divisions, subsidiaries,
              etc. increased complexity and let to the development of Enterprise
              Resource Planning (ERP) software, which is a general ledger plus
              sub-ledgers (e.g., SAP, and Oracle). The above approaches rely on
              trusted owners of at least some ledgers (e.g. bank accounts).

              In theory, the trusted owner of the ledger could become corrupt or
              limit access to assets on the ledger. If corrupt, the same asset
              could be <strong>double-spent</strong>. An asset that can be
              double spent is not limited or credible. The goal then becomes to
              decentralize the ledger.

              To create a decentralized ledger, the
              <strong>Byzantine Generals’ problem</strong> (Lamport, Shostak
              &amp; Pease, 1982) must be solved. Several divisions of the
              Byzantine army surround a city with each division commanded by a
              general. The army must act in unison to be effective and it uses
              messengers to relay attack or retreat commands. However, some
              generals or the messengers may be traitors, relaying false
              messages. A deterministic consensus must be reached through a
              defined mechanism.

              The real breakthrough came with the Bitcoin blockchain: a public,
              append-only ledger that records every BTC transaction. Miners
              (generals) assemble a set of transactions into a candidate block,
              create a block header, and then attempt to solve a cryptographic
              puzzle. The solution to this puzzle, known as "proof of work," is
              included in the block header. Once a miner finds a valid hash,
              they broadcast the full block to the network. Each new block
              includes a reference to the previous block in its header, creating
              a chronological, tamper-resistant chain of blocks. If the block is
              accepted by a majority of miners, it becomes part of the canonical
              chain, and the winning miner receives a BTC reward. This consensus
              process solves the Byzantine Generals Problem. It ensures that all
              honest participants agree on the order and validity of
              transactions. Miners collectively validate that the transaction is
              legitimate (i.e., not a double spend), confirm the identity of
              other miners through cryptographic signatures, verify the proof of
              work, and then link the confirmed block to the chain. Once a
              majority agrees, the network moves forward with the next block
              (attacking in unison).
            </p>

              The BTC blockchain thus solved two core problems: double-spending
              and the Byzantine Generals Problem. For the first time, code
              operates a ledger with guarantees that no asset could be spent
              twice and that tampering would require majority control. This
              control becomes economically irrational through the cost in
              proof-of-work chains to rework multiple blocks and through game
              theory. The value of the network comes from the trust, so if
              someone violates the trust by becoming majority then the network
              loses it's value.

              Financial institutions are now recognizing that decentralized
              ledgers, where code enforces rules, solve core issues of
              coordination and trust in traditional finance at low compliance
              and maintenance costs. Counterparty risk is replaced with platform
              risk.

              <strong>Value of Decentralized Ledgers </strong>
            </h2>
            <p id="2031831a-4c5c-8105-9e1f-c1b8f3f8601b" class="">
              The value of a decentralized ledger is largely determined by the
              significance of the data it secures. People engage with data that
              matters to them, especially when it is tied to their business or
              livelihood. When that data is important, users are more likely to
              interact with the ledger consistently.
            </p>
            <p>
              The volume of data recorded on the ledger reflects the number of
              transactions processed per block, which directly impacts the fees
              collected to sustain the network. In this way, both the relevance
              and the activity level of the data contribute to the overall value
              of the blockchain.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is why many new Layer 1 networks offer financial incentives
              to artificially stimulate activity. They often engage in reverse
              justification, pointing to high transaction volumes as evidence of
              value. The assumption is that if there is activity, there must be
              something meaningful driving it. However, this approach skips the
              critical step of actually securing valuable data or building
              useful applications. Instead, it creates the illusion of demand
              through subsidized or manufactured usage. Without genuine utility,
              this activity is superficial and unsustainable. It is more
              performance than substance.

              The trajectory of total value locked (TVL) of Berachain L1
              provides an example of this contention. After providing marketing
              incentives, the TVL of Berachain’s total value rose markedly, then
              plateaued, and finally plummeted when the incentives were stopped
              (see Figure below).

              This dynamic has been playing out for years in the decentralized
              ledger space and has come to be known as the "L1 trade." It
              reflects the reality that most participants in the space are
              speculators rather than businesses. These speculators move from
              one blockchain to the next, chasing the highest incentives and the
              strongest narratives. Rather than seeking long-term utility or
              building lasting applications, they are drawn to whichever ledger
              offers the most lucrative rewards and can convince others that its
              incentives are worthwhile. As a result, attention and capital
              rotate through ecosystems without creating sustained value.

            <p>
              What the space truly needs are real businesses that benefit from
              moving off costly, centralized ledgers and onto interoperable,
              decentralized ones. These businesses bring meaningful data that
              users care about and interact with—data tied to real-world value
              and activity. By securing important business data on-chain, they
              naturally drive transaction volume and user engagement. This, in
              turn, makes the ledger valuable for the right reasons: not because
              of artificial incentives or hype, but because the underlying data
              and applications genuinely benefit from being on crypto rails.

              Decentralized ledgers are open source by nature. Both their code
              and data are publicly accessible, which makes them easy to
              replicate or fork. As a result, they appear to lack a traditional
              technical moat. So-called “vampire attacks” highlight this
              vulnerability: a competing Layer 1 (L1) can clone the software and
              offer incentives to lure users away from the original network.

              True defensibility does not come from the codebase itself, but
              from owning the production of valuable data. This is why we’re
              seeing the rise of "appchains"—blockchains dedicated to a single
              application or ecosystem. These projects recognize that they are
              the primary source of valuable on-chain activity on
              general-purpose Layer 1s, and they choose to migrate to their own
              ledgers to capture more of the value they create. By operating
              their own chains, these applications gain greater control over
              performance, governance, and economics, aligning the
              infrastructure more closely with their specific needs and
              long-term goals.

              A financial institution seeking the benefits of a ledger that

              General-purpose blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana introduce
              challenges for specialized financial applications. These networks
              do not prioritize one user&#x27;s data over another. As a result,
              high-value financial transactions compete for blockspace alongside
              meme coin trades and NFT sales. This undermines the principle of
              separation of concerns. In traditional software architecture, it
              is considered poor practice to mix unrelated data types in the
              same database table, and a one-size-fits-all database rarely
              performs well across different business functions.

              Relying on existing blockchains can also result in value leakage.
              On Ethereum, for instance, validators have no direct stake in the
              success or safety of a specific application. They process
              transactions and collect fees, regardless of the business purpose
              behind those transactions. In critical moments, they may fail to
              act. Consider the Bitget hack, where $1.4 billion worth of ETH was
              stolen and laundered through Ethereum. Despite the scale of the
              theft, validators, who serve as the chain’s de facto auditors,
              took no meaningful action [2].

              not rely on general-purpose public chains. Instead, it will be
              built on dedicated blockchain rails that are tightly controlled
              and may not involve direct interaction from retail users at the
              protocol level. Retail investors will likely continue to access
              financial products through familiar platforms like Robinhood,
