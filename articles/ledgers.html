              A ledger is a chronological record of asset transfers that permit
              the calculation of financial statements, thereby making ledgers a
              foundational tool for accounting and asset management. Currently,
              accounting software (linked spreadsheets, databases, and
              enterprise resource planning) all rely on one or more trusted
              managers of the ledger, which introduces compliance and regulatory
              costs (governments want manager vetted) and inefficiencies.

              Decentralized ledgers with “trustless” code managing the ledger
              rather than a “trusted” manager decreases costs and improves
              efficiency. However, a decentralized ledger must prevent
              <strong>double spending</strong> and maintain the integrity of the
              ledger (<strong>Byzantine Generals’ Problem</strong>).
              Decentralized ledgers, pioneered by BTC, use proof-of-work and
              distributed consensus between cyrptographically verified
              participants to code transactions being added to the ledger,
              enhancing ledger data integrity and auditability.

              The blockchain and its smart contracts are easily copied or
              emulated, so a blockchain’s success depends on the community using
              the blockchain and its use case. Purpose built L1 blockchains
              (”app chains”) tailored to specific use cases and with tailored
              security features may provide the controlled, specialized
              infrastructure needed to improve the efficiency and decrease costs
              of Traditional Finance trading. Retail does not interact with this
              blockchain; rather they use their apps (Fidelity, Robinhood,
              Paypal, etc.) to trade securities but the backend of the app uses
              the blockchain to bypass the “trusted” manager.

              Definition and Evolution of Ledgers
            </h2>

              A ledger is a structured chronological record of transactions that
              documents transfers of assets from one owner/entity/wallet to
              another. Deconstructing the ledger transactions determines the
              organization’s balance sheet (assets and liabilities) as well as
              profit-loss over a selected timeframe. Ledgers are a
              record-keeping system for accounting. Initially, ledgers were a
              list of transactions entered manually and chronologically into a
              book (book-keeping). However, a typographical error is difficult
              to detect in a single-entry, manual ledger, which led to
              double-entry accounting where each economic event (e.g., purchase
              or sale) is recorded in at at least two ledger accounts: once as a
              debit and then a matching credit transaction. Debits must equal
              credits to balance the books.

            <p id="2031831a-4c5c-80e7-a4a8-f4dc45c58d3f" class="">
              Manual accounting evolved into the use of linked spreadsheets,
              then relational databases (Quickbooks, Peachtree, and Xero).
              Accounting for enterprises with multiple divisions, subsidiaries,
              etc. increased complexity and let to the development of Enterprise
              Resource Planning (ERP) software, which is a general ledger plus
              sub-ledgers (e.g., SAP, and Oracle). The above approaches rely on
              trusted owners of at least some ledgers (e.g. bank accounts).

              In theory, the trusted owner of the ledger could become corrupt or
              limit access to assets on the ledger. If corrupt, the same asset
              could be <strong>double-spent</strong>. An asset that can be
              double spent is not limited or credible. The goal then becomes to
              decentralize the ledger.

              To create a decentralized ledger, the
              <strong>Byzantine Generals’ problem</strong> (Lamport, Shostak
              &amp; Pease, 1982) must be solved. Several divisions of the
              Byzantine army surround a city with each division commanded by a
              general. The army must act in unison to be effective and it uses
              messengers to relay attack or retreat commands. However, some
              generals or the messengers may be traitors, relaying false
              messages. A deterministic consensus must be reached through a
              defined mechanism.

              The real breakthrough came with Bitcoin blockchain, a public,
              append-only ledger that records every BTC transaction. Miners
              assemble the candidate block and its header, then solve the puzzle
              (work), which is included in the header, and the miner with the
              winning hash broadcasts the full block to the network. The new
              transactions includes in its header a link to the previous block,
              forming a time-stamped chain of blocks. If the block is accepted
              by a consensus of miners, the miner receives a BTC reward. The
              consensus step is the solution to Byzantine General Problem. The
              cryptography miner collective must sign off that the transaction
              is valid (no double spend), verify that the miners (generals) are
              real by their cryptographic signature, confirm that the miner
              solved the puzzle, and then link to the next block once a majority
              has signed the current block.

              The BTC blockchain thus solved two core problems: double-spending
              and the Byzantine Generals Problem. For the first time, code
              operates a ledger with guarantees that no asset could be spent
              twice and that tampering would require majority control. This
              control becomes economically irrational through the cost in
              proof-of-work chains to rework multiple blocks and through game
              theory. The value of the network comes from the trust, so if
              someone violates the trust by becoming majority then the network
              has no value.

              Financial institutions are now recognizing that decentralized
              ledgers, where code enforces rules, solve core issues of
              coordination and trust in traditional finance at low compliance
              and maintenance costs. Trusted party risk is replaced with smart
              contract risk.

              Blockchains store ledger transactions as prescribed by code, so
              are not corruptible like a trusted ledger operator controlled by
              humans. As described above for BTC blockchain, decentralized
              blockchain ledgers provide code-controlled read/write permissions
              to the ledger without the need for a trusted maintainer of the
              ledger. As a result, compliance and ensuring the validity of
              transactions on the blockchain is simpler, and cheaper than
              through a trusted provider, who needs to be audited and checked by
              regulatory authorities.

              The value of a L1 blockchain is determined in part by the amount
              and importance of the data being stored. The amount of L1 data
              determines the number of transactions per minute being stored, and
              hence the fees being collected to run the blockchain. The
              importance of the data attracts users to the blockchain. This
              explains why many new L1s offer financial incentives to attract
              users and developers: L1s need users to store their data on the
              ledger and developers to create meaningful products for the L1.

              Decentralized ledgers are open source by nature. Both their code
              and data are publicly accessible, which makes them easy to
              replicate or fork. As a result, they appear to lack a traditional
              technical moat. So-called “vampire attacks” highlight this
              vulnerability: a competing Layer 1 (L1) can clone the software and
              offer incentives to lure users away from the original network.

              True defensibility lies not in the codebase, but in the strength
              of the community—the developers, founders, and users who maintain
              and contribute to the chain—as well as the utility and value of
              the data it secures. For example, Ethereum has a strong network
              effect despite being expensive and slow to evolve. Its design
              centers around a native token for fees and still works well for
              general-purpose use cases such as decentralized exchanges and NFT
              platforms.

              However, the future may belong to interoperable, purpose-built
              blockchains often referred to as "appchains." These are secured

              have direct incentives to improve performance, handle edge cases,
              and retain ownership over the data they generate. By operating on
              their own dedicated chains, they can capture the full value of
              their contributions rather than outsourcing that value to external
              networks. In essence, why allow others to benefit from and secure

              priority financial transactions compete with NFT and meme coin
              trades. This violates the principle of separation of concerns. For
              security, and reliability, it is not recommended to mix two data

              Using existing chains also leaks value. Ethereum validators, who
              have no stake in users’ businesses, secure the data and extract
              value through fees. Worse, the validators may not act when it
              matters. Consider the Bitget hack: $1.4 billion in ETH was stolen
