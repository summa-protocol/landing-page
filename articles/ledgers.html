					Ledgers</strong></h1>
			<h2 id="2021831a-4c5c-8084-8e54-c1e3a25d3a92" class=""><strong>Plumbing</strong></h2>
			<p id="2021831a-4c5c-8055-9509-fa44991bbe73" class="">A ledger is simply a record-keeping system for
				accounting. Historically, ledgers have been error-prone. Mistakes could ruin businesses, and reconciling
				entries between different parties was slow and manual. Major frauds like Enron exploited variability in
				accounting to distort reality.</p>
			<p id="2021831a-4c5c-800a-9f8e-ca337fd215c8" class="">Over time, we moved from pen-and-paper to Excel, then
				to databases. But the real breakthrough came with Bitcoin. It solved two core problems: double-spending
				and the Byzantine Generals Problem. For the first time, code could operate a ledger with guarantees that
				no asset could be spent twice and that tampering would require majority control. This control becomes
				economically irrational through cryptographic consensus.</p>
			<p id="2021831a-4c5c-8058-b99c-ee4edd7a571e" class="">Financial institutions are now recognizing that
				decentralized ledgers, where code enforces rules, solve core issues of coordination and trust in
				traditional finance. Counterparty risk is replaced with smart contract risk.</p>
			<h2 id="2021831a-4c5c-80ac-b517-c804602c34b5" class=""><strong>Ledger Value</strong></h2>
			<p id="2021831a-4c5c-80bb-a434-c52eb60b1712" class="">So, what gives decentralized ledgers their value? Like
				any ledger, the value comes from the data it holds and to whom that data matters. We keep personal
				ledgers to file taxes. Businesses use ledgers to evaluate performance and maintain compliance. The same
				logic applies to blockchains.</p>
			<p id="2021831a-4c5c-8054-926a-e394ff56db2c" class="">A blockchain with no meaningful data is worthless. A
				chain storing trivial information, like bowel movement data, is only valuable to maybe a medical
				researcher. This is why many new L1s offer financial incentives to attract users and developers. They
				need users to store their data on the ledger.</p>
			<p id="2021831a-4c5c-8010-9954-e0825e2781e9" class="">For example, look at Berachain’s total value locked
				(TVL) before and after incentives dried up:</p>

			<p id="2021831a-4c5c-80c1-a93e-d7e78cb9b5d1" class="">Many L1s pay users to move assets onto their ledger,
				but without real utility, this is just mercenary capital. Similarly, some chains pay developers to build
				apps, but if users don’t care, the ledger remains empty.</p>
			<p id="2021831a-4c5c-80e8-bb53-e27bcfdae8a1" class="">Think of a business moving data from Excel to Google
				Sheets. If it’s easy and they’re paid, they’ll do it. But the core issue isn’t the tool; it’s whether
				the data being stored is critical. This arms race of “my system of record is better than yours” misses
				the point. What matters is whose data is on the ledger, who finds it valuable, whether that value
				accrues to the system and whether that data will stay.</p>
			<h2 id="2021831a-4c5c-803b-b726-d1b55862a05b" class=""><strong>To Create or Not to Create?</strong></h2>
			<p id="2021831a-4c5c-805c-a52d-e91c2233b5d6" class="">If you&#x27;re a financial institution needing a
				coordinated, trusted ledger with no double-spend risk, should you use an existing blockchain or start
				your own?</p>
			<p id="2021831a-4c5c-80bc-8a7a-e76e4c044e8d" class="">Public blockchains like Ethereum or Solana are
				general-purpose. But that generality is also a problem. Your valuable financial data would sit next to
				NFT trades and meme coins. This violates the principle of separation of concerns. You wouldn’t mix two
				data types in one database table, nor would you use a one-size-fits-all database for every business
				function.</p>
			<p id="2021831a-4c5c-8087-9507-eaa2d362c9a7" class="">Using existing chains also leaks value. Ethereum
				validators, who have no stake in your business, secure your data and extract value through fees. Worse,
				they may not act when it matters. Consider the Bitget hack: $1.4 billion in ETH was stolen and laundered
				through Ethereum. Validators, the chain’s de facto auditors, did nothing [2].</p>
			<p id="2021831a-4c5c-80f4-ae54-c07e3c1b49b8" class="">Compare that to Sui. In response to a $220 million
				exploit, Sui validators froze the hacker’s wallet, limiting the damage to $60 million [3]. Many Ethereum
				advocates cite inaction as proof of decentralization. But decentralized should not mean paralyzed. A
				network secured by people who care about the data and have skin in the game is more aligned. Businesses
				want auditors who understand their industry, not detached generalists.</p>
			<h2 id="2021831a-4c5c-80b3-9c2d-c4eddc2d7954" class=""><strong>Defensibility: Contracts Are Copyable,
					Communities Are Not</strong></h2>
			<p id="2021831a-4c5c-8046-8e95-c10af3f28874" class="">Smart contracts can be copied. Networks cannot. The
				defensibility of a ledger lies in the community that runs it and the data it secures. Chains like
				Ethereum are slow to upgrade, and their token-centric design forces users to pay fees in native tokens.
				If a ledger’s value depends on arbitrary tokenomics and tribal loyalty, it won’t last.</p>
			<p id="2021831a-4c5c-8033-8659-df368147a465" class="">Instead, the future lies in interoperable, specialized
				ledgers, often called “appchains,” secured by the users who depend on them. These users can optimize
				performance, respond to edge cases, and capture the value their data generates.</p>
			<h2 id="2021831a-4c5c-80e7-b3fa-d288e2dad9f7" class=""><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
			<p id="2021831a-4c5c-8025-8f43-d5dbe86121e9" class="">At its core, a ledger is just a system of record. And
				there’s more than one way to store records. Businesses should choose the right ledger for their needs,
				not the most popular one.</p>
			<p id="2021831a-4c5c-8086-9937-ffea55973010" class="">Traditional finance should not migrate to public
				blockchains like Ethereum or Solana. These institutions are the liquidity. They possess the most
				valuable data in the financial system. They will determine which ledgers succeed.</p>
			<p id="2021831a-4c5c-8036-9d84-dbbb4c20a5d5" class="">The next dominant blockchains will not come from
				retail speculation. They will come from financial institutions building for themselves, ledgers aligned
				with their needs, interoperable with public infrastructure, and defensible through ownership and
				specialization.</p>
